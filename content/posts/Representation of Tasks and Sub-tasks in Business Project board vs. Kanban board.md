## Comparison between Business board vs. Kanban board

![business-board-vs-kanban-board.png](/images/business-board-vs-kanban-board.png)

**On Business Project board**: Sub-tasks are displayed in the `In Progress` column in a tree structure, but actually they are in Status `To Do`. The parent-child relation is visible.

**On (manually) created Kanban board**: All issues are displayed in a flat view. The Sub-tasks remain in the correct column regarding their status but the parent-child relation is less visible at first glance.
