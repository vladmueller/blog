## Comparison between Business board vs. Kanban board

![Pasted image 20250130092706.png](/images/Pasted image 20250130092706.png)

**On Business Project board**: Sub-tasks are displayed in the `In Progress` column in a tree structure, but actually they are in Status `To Do`. The parent-child relation is visible.

**On (manually) created Kanban board**: All issues are displayed in a flat view. The Sub-tasks remain in the correct column regarding their status but the parent-child relation is less visible at first glance.
